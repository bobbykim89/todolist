# todolist
Make Todo list using local storage
displaying time, name, to dos, and weather at current location
background changes randomly every time it loads, using 4 preset images.

Future direction on updating it:
  - Allow scrolling down option when contents exceed displayable size
  - Add checkbox for completed tasks
  - Enable change of orders
  - Add simple description displayable when expanded
  - Clock sometimes stop working, I need to figure out how to fix this
  
 thank you for reading!! :D
